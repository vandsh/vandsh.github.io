Not much to know, I have been developing since about 2009.
Have been in the tech partner/consulting space most of those years, but have been in the enterprise world as well. Sitecore, Drupal and Kentico certified.  Enjoy challenging problems and have a knack for troubleshooting. Other interests outside of development are home automation, home security, networking and light robotics.


Kinda light currently, but some of my open source work is at GitHub:
